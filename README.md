# interesting fact about for loop python while using range!
x = 3
for i in range(x):   # after reading once,  this line wouldn't be executed twice... only the content will be repeated. 
  print(i)
  x -= 1

here, still for loop will work for 3 times! 
learned this today(21/12/2023), while working with TODO app.
Amazing experience. i was thinking  that i can change the runtime, but learned a good lesson.
